Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio Website:
The website is still young in its stages and still under development. The website consists of many eye-catching features which if any interviewer or even a normal person sees for non-professional needs will be very impressed.
The Navigation bar tools include:
1) Home [index.html, styles.css, script.js, aura.js, redirect.js]
2) About me [aboutme.html, aboutmestyles.css, aurastyles.css, aura.js]
3) Work [work.html, work.css, aura.js]
4) Contact me [contact.html, contact.css, aura.js]
In these files, mainly the CSS ones, may contain duplicated code, as code is AI-checked.

Details about commons:
Aura (CSS & JS) = It gives a aura type effect around the cursor (on desktop) while it moves around the site, with smooth transitions.
